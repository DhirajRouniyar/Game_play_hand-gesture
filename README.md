# Game_play_hand-gesture

In this project, you need to detect hand gestures. After detecting the gesture, we’ll assign commands to them. You can even play games with multiple commands using hand gesture recognition.

How gesture recognition works:

Install the Pyautogui library – it helps to control the mouse and keyboard without any user interaction,
Convert it into HSV,
Find contours,
Assign command at any value – below we used 5 (from hand) to jump.
